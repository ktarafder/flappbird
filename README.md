# A Recreation of Flappy Bird - *flappbird*

In this project, I create the classic mobile game, Flappy Bird! I accomplish this using the Unity Engine and writing scripts in C#.
This was my first time using the Unity Engine and my first time coding in C#. I found the process very enjoyable and learned a lot from creating this game.

## Objectives

When I created this project these were the objectives that I had in mind:

- [x] Implement a Title screen which allows user to start game
- [x] Implement a Physics Engine to allow user to control movement of bird vertically
- [x] Spawn two pipes vertically of randon length, each pair being the same distance away from last pair
- [x] Implement a scoring system where user gains a point each time they clear a pair of pipes
- [x] Display score to user on screen, and show score incrementing as user sucessfully clears a pair of pipes, utilizing Unity's new TextMeshPro to do this
- [x] Introduce loss conditions in game when bird hits any pipes or flies outside of the range of the screen
- [x] Display a game over screen when loss condition is met allowing user to play again or return to title screen
- [x] Create a flapping animation for wing of bird within Unity Engine
- [x] Add sound effects to game like bird hitting a pipe through audio source component

## Future Features

These are some features I wish to implement in the future: 
- [ ] Implement system that keeps track of all user scores from playing game and displays the highscore
- [ ] Add "How to Play" button to title screen that makes a popup appear explaining the game
- [ ] Use Unity particle system to make clouds appear in game
